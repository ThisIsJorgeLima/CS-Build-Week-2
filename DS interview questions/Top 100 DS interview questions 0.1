Statistics interview questions:
What is Statistics ?

It is a branch of mathematics pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.
How many Types of statistics are there ?

Descriptive Statistics
Inferential Statistics
What is Descriptive statistics ?

It is help to organize data and focus on the main characteristic of the data and it’s also provides a summary of he data numerically and graphically. (mean, mode, standard deviation, correlation)

What is inferential statistics ?

It generates the larger data and applies probability theory to draw a conclusion

What is mean value in statistics ?

Mean is the average value of the data set.

What is Mode value in statistics ?

The Most repeated value in the data set

What is median value in statistics ?

The middle value from data set

What is normal distribution ?

A) It’s like a bell curve distribution. Mean, Mode and Medium are equal in this distribution. Most of the distributions in statistics are normal distribution.

What is standard normal distribution ?

If mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1 then we call that distribution as standard normal distribution.

What is Binominal Distribution ?

A distribution where only two outcomes are possible, such as success or failure and where the probability of success and failure is same for all the trials then it is called a Binomial Distribution

What is Bernoulli distribution ?

A Bernoulli distribution has only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial.

What is Poisson distribution ?

A distribution is called Poisson distribution when the following assumptions are true:

1. Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event.
2. The probability of success over a short interval must equal the probability of success over a longer interval.
3. The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller.

What is central limit theorem ?

a) Mean of sample means is closely to the mean of the population

b) Standard deviation of the sample distribution can be found out from the population standard deviation divided by square root of sample size N and it is also known as standard error of means.

c) if the population is not normal distribution, but the sample size is greater than 30 the sampling distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution

What is P Value, How it’s useful ?

The p-value is the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test representing the probability of the occurrence of a given event.

If The p-value is  less than 0.05 (p<=0.05), It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, you can reject the Null Hypothesis
If the P-value is higher than 0.05 (p>0.05), It indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, you can fail to reject the null Hypothesis
What is Z value or Z score (Standard Score)  , How it’s useful ?

Z score indicates how many standard deviations on element is from the mean. It is also called standard score.

Z score Formula

z = (X – μ) / σ

It is useful in Statistical testing.
Z-value is range between -3 to 3.
Its useful to find the outliers in large data
What is T-Score, What is the use of it ?

It  is a ratio between the difference between two groups and the difference within the groups. The larger t score, the more difference there is between groups. The smaller t-score means the more similarity between groups.
We can use t-score when the sample size is less than 30, It is used in statistical testing
What is IQR ( Interquartile Range ) and Usage ?

It is difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles,
It is also called Misspread data or Middle 50%.
Mainly to find outliers in data, if the observations that fall below Q1 − 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR those are considered as outliers.
Formula  IQR = Q3-Q1

What is Hypothesis Testing ?

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter.

How many Types of Hypothesis Testing are there ?

Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis
What is Type 1 Error ?

FP – False Positive ( In statistics it is the rejection of a true null hypothesis)

What is Type 2 Error ?

FN – False Negative  ( In statistics it is failing to reject a false null hypothesis)

What is population ?

It is a discrete group of people, animals or things that can be identified by at least one common characteristic for the purposes of data collection and analysis

What is sampling ?

Sampling is a process used in statistical analysis in which a predetermined number of observations are taken from a larger population

Types of sampling techniques ?

There are two major types of sampling
1. PROBABILITY SAMPLING

Simple Random Sampling
Stratified Random Sampling
Systematic Sampling
Cluster Sampling
Multi-stage Sampling
2. NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING

Data Science and Machine learning  Interview Questions:
What is data science ?

Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies.
